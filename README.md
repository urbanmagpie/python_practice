## 🌟 About Me

Hello! I'm a motivated career-changer currently learning Python and exploring how technology and language come together.

I have over 15 years of professional experience in multilingual environments, and I'm fluent in German and English. I'm based in Madrid and actively developing my skills in Python, automation, and version control using Git and GitHub.

I'm especially interested in entry-level opportunities that combine my language skills with technical problem-solving — for example, in support automation, QA, process improvement, or multilingual tech support roles.

This GitHub repo is where I’m tracking my learning through small, focused projects, following the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*.

---

📌 **Goals:**
- Keep building Python projects and expand into web scraping and file automation  
- Learn about APIs, data handling, and basic scripting for real-world problems  
- Use my language skills in a technical context — helping users, improving tools, or supporting teams

Thanks for visiting — and if you're hiring or have advice for someone on this path, I’d love to hear from you.
