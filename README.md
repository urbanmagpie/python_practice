# python-practice

This repo contains small scripts I'm creating while learning Python.

🧠 I'm focused on building my skills step by step with projects from "Automate the Boring Stuff".  
🌍 I speak German and English, and I'm learning Spanish.  
💻 I'm based in Madrid and looking for entry-level tech opportunities where I can combine languages + Python.

Thanks for visiting!
